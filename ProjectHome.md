### NyanDownloader - Multi FileHost Downloader ###

## This is my first proper web-based .NET application which is made to provide direct download link from one of these: ##

> Mediafire links (can also fetch from Embedupload)

> Rapidshare links

> Jumbofiles links

> 2Shared links

> 180Upload links

> 4Shared links

> ZOMG Upload links

> Zippyshare links

> Depositfiles links

### Features: ###

- Lightning fast processing of links without waiting time, faster than JDownloader (but could be further improved)

- Multiple link queuing (similar to JDownloader)

- Ability to process Mediafire folder links to fetch and process download links from them

- Reads link from Clipboard if you don't feel like pasting the links =P

- Copy generated links to Clipboard

- An online music server which streams Anime OST which you can listen while you use the downloader

- Timeout and Retry Count settings in cases when your net is unstable or want to bypass random captchas

- Proxy sever support for those who wish to use proxy server address and port to bypass ISP or filehost restrictions

Some of features which I may further extend in future versions are:

- Multiple link downloading within the application (similar to JDownloader)

- ??? Can't think of any other ideas as of now =P

### Requirements: ###

# Windows XP (SP3), Vista (SP1 or above), Windows 7

# .NET Framework 2.0
